<h1>Movie Land</h1>

<p>A simple ReactJS website that displays the information of top 10 movies you search on the Search bar.
</p>The API is fetcehd from - <a href="https://www.omdbapi.com/">OMDb API</a>. Whenever someone searches for a movie or a series, this API takes the name searched and fetches all the information regarding it. This information is then displayed on screen<p>
<p>I employed functional components and ReactJS hooks, specifically useState and useEffect, to enable the site to render dynamically without requiring a page reload. Within the JSX file, the MovieCard component is responsible for displaying essential information such as the title of the movie or series and its publication year.</p>

<p> Here's a look into the website</p>
